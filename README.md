# NLP_Philosophical_Texts

The experiment involves the analysis of philosophical texts from different currents. 
In particular, the project focuses on:
- Word Usage Analyis (GloVe and Word2Vec)
- Sentiment Analysis (iSA, BERT and roBERTa)
- Classification (BERT)

To replicate the procedures carried out, it will be sufficient to run the python notebook in its entirety. To replicate the results obtained with iSA, first we need to download the tag_df and no_tag_df datasets and then use the R code.
